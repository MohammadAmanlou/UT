##  This is a demonstration of how you can carry out S-boxes based substitution
##  in DES.  The code shown implements the "Substitution with 8 S-boxes" step 
##  that you see inside the dotted Feistel function in Figure 4 of Lecture 3 notes.

##  IMPORTANT:  This demonstration code does NOT include XORing with the round
##              key that must be carried out on the expanded right-half block
##              before it is subject to the S-boxes based substitution step
##              shown here.
